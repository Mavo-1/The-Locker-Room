This is an app Im working on to help places like the YMCA with rostering their youth sports teams. At the moment, a majority of YMCA's are using the help of excel to manage teams. Although excel is an amazing tool, you run into a lot of complications when you use it for the sole purpose of managing rosters and team details.
